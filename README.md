# AI-Image-Classifier

This project involved building a machine learning model that can effectively classify real images and those generated by AI. The first step was to create a dataset comprising AI-generated and real images. To accomplish this, pygoogle_image is used , with which images from Google are downloaded. Apart from Google Images, two more datasets are used.

1. CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images
2. Ai Generated Images | Images Created using Ai from Kaggle

Then, a Convulutional Nueral Network based Classifier model was constructed and trained on the dataset containing around 1,00,000 images.
