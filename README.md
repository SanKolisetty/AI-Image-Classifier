# Brief Overview
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This project involved building a machine learning model that can classify real and AI generated images. The first step was to create a dataset comprising AI-generated and real images. To accomplish this, `pygoogle_image` was used, with which images from Google were downloaded. Apart from Google Images, two more datasets were used.

1. CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images 
2. Ai Generated Images | Images Created using Ai from Kaggle

These images were preprocessed and features were extracted. Then, a Convulutional Nueral Network based Classifier model was constructed and trained on the dataset containing around 1,00,000 images.
