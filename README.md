<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

<!-- Add badges with link to Shields IO -->

# Quickstart/Demo

<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

I believe that you should bring value to the reader as soon as possible. You should be able to get the user up and running with your project with minimal friction.

If you have a quickstart guide, this is where it should be.

Alternatively, you can add a demo to show what your project can do.

# Table of Contents

GitHub has a ToC feature now. It works really well, so this might not be needed. Still, if you want to add a ToC in the README, you can add it here.

I just learned that VS Code automatically updates the ToC if you change any of the headings. Pretty cool!
